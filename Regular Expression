# Regular-expression
Chapter 11- Python for everybody
Exercise 1: Write a simple program to simulate the operation of the
grep command on Unix. Ask the user to enter a regular expression and
count the number of lines that matched the regular expression:

$ python grep.py
Enter a regular expression: ^Author
mbox.txt had 1798 lines that matched ^Author

$ python grep.py
Enter a regular expression: ^Xmbox.txt
had 14368 lines that matched ^X-

import re
f=open('mbox.txt')
count=0
for line in f:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if re.search('^X-', line):
        count=count+1
print("mbox.txt had", count, "lines that matched ^X-")
mbox.txt had 14368 lines that matched ^X-

Exercise 2: Write a program to look for lines of the form:
New Revision: 39772
Extract the number from each of the lines using a regular expression
and the findall() method. Compute the average of the numbers and
print out the average.
Enter file:mbox.txt
38444.0323119

import re
f=open('mbox.txt')
count=0
sum=0
for line in f:
    line=line.rstrip()
    x=re.findall('^New Revision:\s([0-9]+)',line)
    for i in range(len(x)):
        count+=1
        sum+=int(x[i]) 
average=sum/count   
print(average)
38549.79497206704

Enter file:mbox-short.txt
39756.9259259

import re
f=open('mbox-short.txt')
count=0
sum=0
for line in f:
    line=line.rstrip()
    x=re.findall('^New Revision:\s([0-9]+)',line)
    for i in range(len(x)):
        count+=1
        sum+=int(x[i]) 
average=sum/count   
print(average)
39756.92592592593
