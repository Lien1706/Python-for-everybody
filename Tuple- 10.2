10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.

name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
d=dict()
for line in handle:
    line=line.rstrip()
    word=line.split()
    if not line.startswith("From "): continue
    s=word[5]
    s1=s.split(":")
    s2=s1[0]	
    if s2 not in d:
        d[s2]=1
    else:
        d[s2]+=1
l =d.items()
l.sort()
for k, v in l:
    print (k,v)
